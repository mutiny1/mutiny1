### Professional Summary

With over 18 years of experience in the healthcare sector, I specialize in VMware and PowerShell. My focus includes VMware and PowerCLI, developing custom functions and modules, and creating one-off scripts for specific needs. I emphasize streamlining processes and reducing human error in the dynamic IT landscape of healthcare. Recently, I've expanded into full automation using Packer and GitLab (runners) to ensure consistent workflows and outcomes.
